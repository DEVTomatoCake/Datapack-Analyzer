# Minecraft Datapack Analyzer
Allows you to analyze and generate stats for Minecraft Datapacks.

Inspired by [ErrorCraft's FunctionAnalyser](https://github.com/ErrorCraft/FunctionAnalyser) - this is basically the same, but *uh*, different :D

## Ideas/TODO

[ ] Add more statistics, like amount of functions, scoreboards, ...
[ ] Warn on invalid/outdated commands
[ ] Display information from pack.mcmeta
[ ] Image render of datapack function connection calls?
[ ] Add resourcepack functionality
[ ] Better design
[ ] More useful menubar (about project etc)
[ ] Better error if no files are found
