# Minecraft Datapack Analyzer
Allows you to analyze and generate stats for Minecraft Datapacks.

Inspired by [ErrorCraft's FunctionAnalyser](https://github.com/ErrorCraft/FunctionAnalyser) - this is basically the same, but *uh*, different :D
Uses [misode's mcmeta](https://github.com/misode/mcmeta) for historical data.

## Ideas/TODO

[ ] Add more statistics, like amount of functions, scoreboards, ...
[ ] Warn on invalid/outdated commands
[ ] Image render of datapack function connections?
[ ] Better error if no files are found
[ ] Add resourcepack functionality
[ ] Add settings for white-/darkmode themes, maybe multiple languages?
