# Minecraft Datapack Analyzer
Allows you to analyze and generate stats for Minecraft Datapacks.

Inspired by [ErrorCraft's FunctionAnalyser](https://github.com/ErrorCraft/FunctionAnalyser) - this is basically the same, but *uh*, different :D
<br>Uses [misode's mcmeta](https://github.com/misode/mcmeta) for historical data.

## Ideas/TODO

- Add more statistics, like amount of functions, scoreboards, ...
- Warn on invalid/outdated commands
- Image render of datapack function connections?
- Add resourcepack functionality
- Multi language support
